					TYPOGRAPHY, even when poorly executed, can never be taken for granted;
					nor is it ever accidental. Indeed, beautifully typeset pages are always
					the result of long experience. Now and then they even attain the rank of
					great artistic achievement. But the art of typesetting stands apart from
					expressive artwork, because the appeal is not limited to a small
					circle. It is open to everyone's critical judgment, and nowhere does this
					judgment carry more weight. Typography that can- not be read by everybody
					is useless. Even for someone who constantly ponders matters of
					readability and legibility, it is difficult to determine whether
					something can be read with ease, but the average reader will rebel at
					once when the type is too small or otherwise irritates the eye; both are

					All typography consists of letters. These appear either in the form of a
					smoothly running sentence or as an assembly of lines, which may even have
					contrasting shapes. Good typography begins, and this is no minor
					matter, with the typesetting of a single line of text in a book or a
					newspaper. Using exactly the same typeface, it is possible to create either
					a pleasant line, easily read, or an onerous one. Spacing, if it is too wide
					or too compressed, will spoil almost any typeface.
